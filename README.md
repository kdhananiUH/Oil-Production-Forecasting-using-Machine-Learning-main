## 1. Objective:

To develop a data-driven alternative method for predicting the cumulative oil production of resources that lacks historical data and has variable model parameters.

## 2. Problem to be solved & Current practice:

Traditional methods of predicting oil production may be limited by the amount of computational power available, making it difficult to analyze large amounts of data. AI/ML can identify patterns and relationships in the data to make more accurate predictions, while also learning from new data to continually improve accuracy.

## 3. Goal:

To help oil and gas companies determine the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of a well and make informed financial and operational decisions based on available production and well completion data.

## 4. Data requirements:

We will collect data of around 300-400 wells in the Permian Basin field from Enverus(Drillinginfo) and the Railroad Commission of Texas' Oil & Gas Division.

## 5. Analysis:

We will develop a proxy-well model for predicting cumulative oil production using statistically significant production parameters and reservoir information as independent predictor variables in machine learning models. We will apply a feature selection method to extract key features of a well's time-rate production profile, which will be used to estimate cumulative oil production.

## 6. Vision of success:

Success will be measured by the accuracy of the data-driven model in predicting cumulative oil production for resources with limited extensive production histories and extremely variable model parameters. We will evaluate the success of the model based on its ability to help oil and gas companies determine the EUR of a well and make strategic financial and operational decisions based on available production and well completion data.
